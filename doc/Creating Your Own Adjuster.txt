To create your own adjuster it's fairly simple if you already know where to patch.

--> How to?
    To create your own adjuster you need to instantiate a new object derived from the class 'Adjuster' or 'SimpleAdjuster' from LimitAdjuster.h
    The difference between them is that 'Adjuster' allows you to make the object handle many limits while the SimpleAdjuster will allow the object to
    handle only a single limit. As you may have noticed, SimpleAdjuster interface is cleaner and simpler.

    You can see samples of how to create the adjuster at "src/sample/sample.cpp"
    To see pratical adjusters, see the many .cpp files in the src folder.
    
    Yes, you only need to create an single .cpp file and make your patches there, you don't need to modify any other source file!
    After you have your .cpp file, please don't forget to add it to the CMakeLists.txt script!
